    // I have this working on a local branch, but instead of sending the fix, 
    // these notes document the thought process and debugging techniques that 
    // lead to the solution. 

    // If it still doesn't click after another hour of dev, then I'll push
    // the working branch and we can walk through it together.

    // As far as I can tell, the compilation stage was successful, which
    // suggests, as you have already identified, the error is on the client
    // and it likely has something to do with this function. 

		jade.render(document.getElementById('main-content'), 'test1');

    // Think of this entire process as loading a gun. You purchased bullets 
    // (wrote jade templates) and loaded them into the gun (ran the compilation
    // in the terminal). The only thing left, to efficiently slay the zombie,
    // is to aim & fire. 

    // The function above is how you fire. It is pulling the trigger, but it
    // doesn't know where to aim (or it is being told to aim somewhere it shouldn't). 
    // I know this because chrome console tells us, "Uncaught TypeError: 
    // Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of null at templates.js:184."

    // The source at line 184 is trying to set the innerHTML of something that
    // is null, because we are aiming at the void and don't have a
    // and the zombies aren't even around yet.

    // Finally, think of the arguments you send jade.render like this:
    //
    // "Hi Andy! Please call me and answer the following questions!" - jade.render
    //
    // jade.render( 
    //    1[Where do you want to send the template you compiled?],
    //    2[How would you like me to reference it internally? This wont matter to you yet, but I need it for later.],
    //    3[You don't have to answer this one, but do you have any json data used in the original jade files?
    //      If so, please put it here. Otherwise, please leave this argument out.]
    // );
    //
    //
